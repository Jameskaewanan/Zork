You are a soldier of the Imperium of Man stationed aboard the Defiant Class Light Cruiser.
This mission was like one of many, a patrol across the Galactic segment the "Ultima Segmentum".
It was a relatively peaceful afternoon, your shift has ended and you are in your cabin
chatting with your fellow guardsmen. Suddenly you are alerted by an emergency broadcast...
"Attention all guardsmen, an Ork raiding party has forcefully boarded our vessel,
all personal must gather arms and purge the heretics from our craft. Do what you must
to repel the green skins. Seek out and kill their leader, the Gorkanaut, and surely they
will flee. Glory to the Emperor and to the Imperium of Man!"
%
You have successfully killed the Gorkanaut, Many of your fellow brothers have fallen.
As you attempt to relay a distress signal to any nearby Space Marine fleet, A sharp
pain of a thousand suns pierced your heart. You hear an Ork uttering "Ave got one uff
da flesh lit'l wimps! E' was tryin' to contak da muhreens fah help." Over hearing the
the incomprehensible blabbering coming from that Ork's mouth, you realise this was scouting
party. The dreaded Ork WAAAAAGH! is on the way... And you could nothing to warn your fellow
brothers about it.
